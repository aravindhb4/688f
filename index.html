  jQuery is a common JavaScript library for reading and making changes to the
  Document Object Model (DOM). The DOM is a tree that contains information
  about what is actually visible on a website.

  While HTML is a static document, the browser converts HTML to the
  DOM and the DOM can change. In fact, JavaScript's power comes from
  its ability to manipulate the DOM, which is essentially a JavaScript
  object. When JavaScript makes something interesting happen on a
  website, it's likely the action happened because JavaScript changed
  the DOM. jQuery is fast and easy to use, but it doesn't do anything
  you can't accomplish with vanilla (regular) JavaScript.

  The next line tells the browser where to download the JavaScript file you'll be
  writing. In resumeBuilder.js, you'll be writing code that builds the resume
  dynamically when this website, index.html, is opened.
